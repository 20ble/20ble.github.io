            <h2>PROGRAM SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>You are in the 1900s during World War II. You get to choose which side and country you are in.<br>
            Choose your designated unit, whether infantry or commanding officer, and make decisions that will<br>
            determine the outcome of the war.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <p>When it came to incremental processes, I first started off with my most distinct point,<br>
            the introduction, which led to the side choice. From the side choice, I had to code the 2 possible inputs<br>
            to their given choices by using boolean expressions. That led to an expansion on the story and<br>
            3 other choices, and this repeats until they have reached the ending to their path. Another distinct point is when<br>
            you get to choose whether or not to negotiate peace terms. However, both choices lead to the same outcome.<br>
            When it came to iteration processes, I repeated my code and laid out the paths using my flow chart<br>
            before my partner inputed the story. My whole program structure was developed independently by me as I<br>
            coded all the paths that the story reader can take. My partner, Viet, focused mainly on coding the storyline.<br>
            Difficulties that I've encountered were forgeting where I was when I was coding the<br>
            program, and making sure that each path is connected to each other in the sequence<br>
            I want it to.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>PROCEDURAL ABSTRACTION</h2>
            <p>Organizing my scenes into functions is a form of procedural abstraction<br>
            because it segregates each unique code into a function in which I will be<br>
            be able to understand. The advantages of using procedural abstraction is<br>
            I can easily read and implement the code, and it also allows me to easily<br>
            fix my mistakes.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>ONE STORY THAT I PERSONALLY ENJOYED</h2>
            <p>One story that I found entertaining was Edwin's program.<br>
            It was a story in which you can choose to be a security guard or a robber at a bank.<br>
            I really liked how I let the robbers steal and run off with the money as a security guard.<br>
            The story was well-thought, and I can tell Edwin put a lot of time into it.</p>

            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>You are a penguin, living on the moon, collecting fruit to feed your<br>
            family. You are on a mission that requires you to use your primitive skills<br>
            in order to ensure that future generations will live on. I implemented<br>
            a scoring system by making a points system with the variable, CASH MONEY.<br>
            The points system varies by the unique fruits you collect; you can lose<br>
            points or gain points. The way you lose the game is by collecting 3<br>
            bananas, and the way you progress is by achieving more than 50 CASH MONEY.<br>
            The use of randomness occurs when the fruits are either collected by the<br>
            penguin or fall down to a certain point, where they are teleported to a<br>
            random x-position and fixed y-position. The game becomes more difficult<br>
            after achieving more than 50 CASH MONEY because the speed of the fruits<br>
            become faster and fluctuates.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>I was inspired to name and create this game by my friend whose name is<br>
            PenguinMan24. I made the concept of the game similar to a game I played<br>
            when I was a kid since it gave me a sense of nostalgia. Two successful<br>
            points while making my game were making the fruits spawn randomly and<br>
            the controls for the penguin. Two obstacles while making my game were<br>
            sensing whether the fruit has touched the ground and making the game<br>
            progress upon reaching 50 CASH MONEY. Through trial and error, I figured<br>
            out how to program those components of my game. If I had more time to<br>
            work on this game, I would improve its difficulty factor so you can choose<br>
            between levels of difficulty. I can implement "Easy, Medium, or Hard" after<br>
            clicking play.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>An algorithm that contributes significantly to my game is how the<br>
            Penguin collects the fruits. It works by sensing if the penguin has<br>
            touched any of the fruits in which it sends a broadcast to those fruits<br>
            to change the CASH MONEY accordingly and to spawn randomly with their<br>
            cooldowns.</p>
