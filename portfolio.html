            <h2>GAME DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>You are a penguin, living on the moon, collecting fruit to feed your<br>
            family. You are on a mission that requires you to use your primitive skills<br>
            in order to ensure that future generations will live on. I implemented<br>
            a scoring system by making a points system with the variable, CASH MONEY.<br>
            The points system varies by the unique fruits you collect; you can lose<br>
            points or gain points. The way you lose the game is by collecting 3<br>
            bananas, and the way you progress is by achieving more than 50 CASH MONEY.<br>
            The use of randomness occurs when the fruits are either collected by the<br>
            penguin or fall down to a certain point, where they are teleported to a<br>
            random x-position and fixed y-position. The game becomes more difficult<br>
            after achieving more than 50 CASH MONEY because the speed of the fruits<br>
            become faster and fluctuates.</p>

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>I was inspired to name and create this game by my friend whose name is<br>
            PenguinMan24. I made the concept of the game similar to a game I played<br>
            when I was a kid since it gave me a sense of nostalgia. Two successful<br>
            points while making my game were making the fruits spawn randomly and<br>
            the controls for the penguin. Two obstacles while making my game were<br>
            sensing whether the fruit has touched the ground and making the game<br>
            progress upon reaching 50 CASH MONEY. Through trial and error, I figured<br>
            out how to program those components of my game. If I had more time to<br>
            work on this game, I would improve its difficulty factor so you can choose<br>
            between levels of difficulty. I can implement "Easy, Medium, or Hard" after<br>
            clicking play.</p>

            <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>An algorithm that contributes significantly to my gameis how the<br>
            Penguin collects the fruits. It works by sensing if the penguin has<br>
            touched any of the fruits in which it sends a broadcast to those fruits<br>
            to change the CASH MONEY accordingly and to spawn randomly with their<br>
            cooldowns.</p>
